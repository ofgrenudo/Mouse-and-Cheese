# Mouse and Cheese

Mouse and Cheese is a fun and simple game developed by the **Kalamazoo Valley Community College (KVCC) Animation and Game Club** during the **Spring 2025 Semester Game Jam**. The goal of the game is to collect all the cheese while avoiding a dangerous dust bunny. If you collect all the cheese, you win! But if you touch the dust bunny, it's game over.

## Gameplay
- Control the mouse and navigate the environment.
- Collect all the pieces of cheese scattered around the level.
- Avoid the dust bunny at all costs!
- Win by collecting all the cheese without getting caught by the dust bunny.
